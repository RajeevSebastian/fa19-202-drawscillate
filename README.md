## Building & Running

We suggest building & running the app through through a general-purpose IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA). If you're using macOS, make sure to build & run with JDK 8; newer versions may fail according to [this source](https://discourse.processing.org/t/keep-getting-noclassdeffounderror-errors-on-mac/11727).
